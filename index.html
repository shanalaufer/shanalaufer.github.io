<h2>About Me</h2>

<p> 
Hi! My name is Shoshana! I am 16 years old and live on Long Island, NY.
 <br/>I currently attend Stella K. Abraham High School for Girls in Hewlett NY. 
 <br/>I love to play tennis and I am a member of my school team. 
 <br/>My favorite subject to study is History.
 <br/>I first became interested in coding while taking a two year engineering course in school.
 <br/>
